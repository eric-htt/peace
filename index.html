      <p>"There's a Palestine that dwells inside all of us, a Palestine that needs to be rescued: a free Palestine where all people regardless of color, religion, or race coexist; a Palestine where the meaning of the word "occupation" is only restricted to what the dictionary says rather than those plenty of meanings and connotations of death, destruction, pain, suffering, deprivation, isolation and restrictions that Israel has injected the word with." - Refaat Alareer</p>
      <o>"Sometimes a homeland becomes a tale. We love the story because it is about our homeland and we love our homeland even more because of the story." - Refaat Alareer</p>
<o>“If a Palestinian bulldozer were ever invented (Haha, I know!) and I were given the chance to be in an orchard, in Haifa for instance,I would never uproot a tree an Israeli planted. No Palestinian would. To Palestinians, the tree is sacred, and so is the Land bearing it” - Refaat Alareer</p>

<p>"Of all the people around me, you know best that it takes two to complete a story; it always does." - Refaat Alareer</p>
<p>"The refugee card was and continues to be an insult to remind us of the little that refugees get in comparison with what they have really lost. Would a bag of flour compensate for the farmland they once had? Would a bag of sugar make up for the bitter misery those people have always felt after losing their sweet homes to dwell in refugee camps? Would the two bottles of oil make them forget their olive trees, which had been mercilessly uprooted as they themselves were? Or maybe it is simply a declaration that they are temporary refugees who once had the land which, as long as this card is still in their hands, would still be waiting for them to return. Only a shot of sharp pain brought me back to the present." - Refaat Alareer</p>
<p>"A picture is not going to be like a stone that has been subjected to the rain and the heat and the cold and the dirt and the smell of Jerusalem. This stone is Jerusalem. It is." - Refaat Alareer</p>

      <p>"Keep on moving to the first rays of dawn, keeping it on 'til the day stays strong. Run till the night time blazes on." - Matisyahu</p>

      <!-- More names can be added here -->
    </div>

    <div class="container plan">
      <h2>Plan of Action</h2>
      <h3>Inspiration</h3>
      <p>Our inspiration for this project is the Vietnam War Memorial in Washington, D.C. The Vietnam War Memorial is a black wall with the names of all the American soldiers who died in the Vietnam War. The wall is a powerful reminder of the human cost of war, and it is a place where people can go to mourn their loved ones. We hope that this project can serve a similar purpose for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>
      <h3>Phase 1</h3>
      <p>Phase 1 will be the creation of a website that will serve as
      a memorial for the dead. It will include a list of the dead, as
      well as a link for each name to a reputable news source
      reporting on the death of the individual.</p>
      <h3>Phase 2</h3>
      <p>Phase 2 will be the construction of a temporary border wall
      in downtown Berkeley, California, as well as any other location
      where people are working toward peace. The wall will be
      constructed of wood and paper, and will sit on wheels for easy
      movement. The wall will be constructed in a public space. The
      names of the Israeli dead will be on the side meant to face the
      Gaza Strip, and the names of the Palestinian dead will be on the
      side meant to face Israel. (The intent here is that more killing
      will only serve to add more names to the list that one's
      descendants will be looking at for generations to come.) Both
      sides will have extensive artwork and extensive quotes from
      various wisdom traditions. All the names of the dead will be
      written in Arabic, Hebrew, and English, and will have QR codes
      that link to the reputable news source describing their
      death. An Israeli flag will be placed on the side of the wall
      meant to face Israel, and a Palestinian flag will be placed on
      the side of the wall meant to face Gaza. American and Iranian
      flags will be placed atop the wall, in recognition of the role
      of more powerful countries in prolonging the conflict. It is
      hoped that the walls that are built throughout the world will
      become places of peaceful protest and respectful debate. But
      they will also be fairly natural targets for terrorists of all
      nations, so it will require both courage and dedication to build
      them in public places, and they will need to be well-defended by
      local police and security forces.
      </p>
      <h3>Phase 3</h3>
      <p>Phase 3 will be the construction of a temporary border wall
      in Gaza, after there is a ceasefire. The wall will be
      constructed of the finest cedar wood that can be obtained with
      donated funds that could have otherwise gone to take care of the
      remaining civilians in Gaza, and otherwise similar to the wall
      in Berkeley. The wall will be constructed in a public space. The
      names of the Israeli dead will be on the side facing Gaza, and
      the names of the Palestinian dead will be on the side facing
      Israel. Both sides will have extensive artwork and extensive
      quotes from various wisdom traditions. The wall will remain on
      wheels until there is a formal peace process mediated by the UN
      that results in the creation of two coequal states; this is
      meant to emphasize the temporary nature of any resolution to the
      conflict that is not rooted in true reconciliation and hope for
      a just and lasting peace.</p>
      <h3>Phase 4</h3>
      <p>Phase 4 will be the construction of a permanent border
        wall. The wall will be constructed of material sufficiently
        strong to withstand a suicide bombing, and otherwise made of
        the finest material that can be obtained with donated funds
        that could have otherwise gone to take care of the remaining
        survivors on both sides. The wall will be constructed in a
        public space. The names of the Israeli dead will be on the
        side facing Gaza. The names of the Palestinian dead will be on
        the side facing Israel. Both sides will have extensive artwork
        and extensive quotes from various wisdom traditions. It is
        hoped that peacekeeping forces can maintain order well enough
        that the wall will not need to be on wheels.</p>
