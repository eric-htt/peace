      <p>"There's a Palestine that dwells inside all of us, a Palestine that needs to be rescued: a free Palestine where all people regardless of color, religion, or race coexist; a Palestine where the meaning of the word "occupation" is only restricted to what the dictionary says rather than those plenty of meanings and connotations of death, destruction, pain, suffering, deprivation, isolation and restrictions that Israel has injected the word with." - Refaat Alareer</p>

<p>"The refugee card was and continues to be an insult to remind us of the little that refugees get in comparison with what they have really lost. Would a bag of flour compensate for the farmland they once had? Would a bag of sugar make up for the bitter misery those people have always felt after losing their sweet homes to dwell in refugee camps? Would the two bottles of oil make them forget their olive trees, which had been mercilessly uprooted as they themselves were? Or maybe it is simply a declaration that they are temporary refugees who once had the land which, as long as this card is still in their hands, would still be waiting for them to return. Only a shot of sharp pain brought me back to the present." - Refaat Alareer</p>

      <p>"Rebuild the temple and the crown of glory. Years gone by, about sixty. Burn in the oven in this century, and the gas tried to choke, but it couldn't choke me." - Matisyahu</p>
      <p>"Keep on moving to the first rays of dawn, keeping it on 'til the day stays strong. Run till the night time blazes on." - Matisyahu</p>

      <h2>Plan of Action</h2>
      <h3>Inspiration</h3>
      <p>Our inspiration for this project is the Vietnam War Memorial in Washington, D.C. The Vietnam War Memorial is a black wall with the names of all the American soldiers who died in the Vietnam War. The wall is a powerful reminder of the human cost of war, and it is a place where people can go to mourn their loved ones. We hope that this project can serve a similar purpose for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>
      <h3>Phase 1</h3>
      <p>Phase 1 will be the creation of a website that will serve as
      a memorial for the dead. It will include a list of the dead, as
      well as a link for each name to a reputable news source
      reporting on the death of the individual.</p>
      <h3>Phase 2</h3>
      <p>Phase 2 will be the construction of a temporary border wall
      in downtown Berkeley, California. The wall will be constructed
      of wood and paper, and will sit on wheels for easy movement. The
      wall will be constructed in a public space. The names of the
      Israeli dead will be on the side meant to face the Gaza Strip,
      and the names of the Palestinian dead will be on the side meant
      to face Israel. Both sides will have extensive artwork and
      extensive quotes from various wisdom traditions. All the names
      of the dead will be written in Arabic, Hebrew, and English, and
      will have QR codes that link to the reputable news source
      describing their death. An Israeli flag will be placed on the
      side of the wall meant to face Israel, and a Palestinian flag
      will be placed on the side of the wall meant to face
      Gaza. American flags will be placed atop the wall.
      </p>
      <h3>Phase 3</h3>
      <p>Phase 3 will be the construction of a temporary border wall
      in Gaza, after there is a ceasefire. The wall will be
      constructed of the finest cedar wood that can be obtained with
      donated funds that could have otherwise gone to take care of the
      remaining civilians in Gaza, and otherwise similar to the wall
      in Berkeley. The wall will be constructed in a public space. The
      names of the Israeli dead will be on the side facing Gaza, and
      the names of the Palestinian dead will be on the side facing
      Israel. Both sides will have extensive artwork and extensive
      quotes from various wisdom traditions. The wall will remain on
      wheels until there is a formal peace process mediated by the UN
        that results in the creation of two coequal states.</p>
      <h3>Phase 4</h3>
      <p>Phase 4 will be the construction of a permanent border
        wall. The wall will be constructed of the finest cedar wood that
        can be obtained with donated funds that could have otherwise
        gone to take care of the remaining survivors on both sides. The wall
        will be constructed in a public space. The names of the Israeli
        dead will be on the side facing Gaza. The names of the Palestinian
        dead will be on the side facing Israel. Both sides will have
        extensive artwork and extensive quotes from various wisdom
        traditions.
